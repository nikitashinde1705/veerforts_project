                    <p>
                        Shivaji Maharaj's coronation, or Rajyabhishek, took place on June 6, 1674, at Raigad Fort,
                        formally establishing his sovereignty and inaugurating the Hindavi Swarajya (Maratha Empire).
                        Conducted by the scholarly Gagabhatta of Varanasi, the ceremony legitimized his rule, and he was
                        conferred with the title Chhatrapati. The occasion marked the beginning of a new era, the Shiv
                        Rajyabhisheka Shaka, and featured the minting of special coins, solidifying his independence and
                        sovereignty

                    <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sovereignty: The coronation symbolized the aspiration for self-rule and the victory of
                        nationalism, creating a recognized Hindu king in a time of Mughal dominance.
                        New Era: A new calendar era, the "Shiv Rajyabhisheka Shaka," was proclaimed, beginning on the
                        day of the coronation.
                        Symbolic Act: Special coins were minted, a gold coin called the "hon" and a copper coin called
                        "Shivraj," bearing the inscription "Shri Raja Shivachhatrapati," further symbolizing his
                        sovereignty.
                        Title: Shivaji Maharaj assumed the title of Chhatrapati, a symbolic representation of his
                        kingship and authority.

                        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti is celebrated annually on February 19 to mark the birth
                        anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji, one of the bravest and most progressive rulers of India.
                        Chhatrapati Shivaji was the founder of the Maratha Empire. A great military administrator and
                        tactician, Chhatrapati Shivaji fought and won several wars against the Mughals. He was crowned
                        as the "Chhatrapati (Emperor)" in 1674. His bravery and quotes on life continue to inspire us.
                        People across the nation, especially in Maharashtra, observe his birth anniversary as Shivaji
                        Jayanti. This year marks the 395th birth anniversary of the Maratha King.

                        Jijamata Jayanti is celebrated on January 12th to commemorate the birth anniversary of Jijabai
                        Bhosale, the mother of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Celebrations honor her significant role in
                        shaping Shivaji Maharaj's life, fostering his values of courage, leadership, and justice, and
                        inspiring the vision of the Maratha Empire. Festivities often include cultural programs,
                        speeches, and the lighting of lamps to remember her contributions to the Maratha Kingdom.

                        Key events in the life of Sambhaji Maharaj include his birth in 1657, his coronation in 1680,
                        his successful defense against Mughal Aurangzeb, and his eventual capture and execution in 1689
                        after being betrayed by a former ally. His reign was characterized by constant warfare and
                        resistance against Mughal forces, culminating in his heroic martyrdom.
