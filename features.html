                                    Forts were mainly built for safety and protection. Kings, queens, armies, and people
                                    needed a safe place to defend themselves from enemy attacks and invasions. They also
                                    acted like a shield against wild animals and robbers. <br>
                                    👉 Shivaji Maharaj built many forts like Raigad and Pratapgad to protect
                                    his kingdom from the Mughals.

                                    Forts were the main battle centers. During wars, soldiers stayed inside the forts,
                                    defended from the walls, and used cannons or arrows to attack enemies from height.
                                    They also stored food, water, and weapons to fight long wars (called sieges).
                                    👉 Example: The Sinhagad Fort in Maharashtra is famous for the battle where Tanaji
                                    Malusare fought bravely inside the fort.

                                    They were made with hard stones, lime, and iron clamps. Walls were very thick and
                                    high so cannons could not easily break them. Many forts still stand after hundreds
                                    of years, showing their strength.
                                    👉 Example: Daulatabad Fort has massive stone walls that are still intact.

                    <h2>Harishchandragad Fort</h2>
                    <p>Harishchandragad’s origins can be traced back to the 6th century, during the reign of the
                        Kalachuri dynasty. The fort’s strategic location, overlooking the Malshej Ghat, made it a
                        crucial stronghold for controlling the region’s trade routes and guarding against invaders. Over
                        the years, the fort witnessed numerous battles, passing through the hands of various rulers,
                        including the Mughals and the Marathas.</p>

                                <p>Lohagad Fort is a majestic hill fort situated in the Sahyadri hills of Maharashtra,
                                    India. It is located near the hill station of Lonavala and stands at an impressive
                                    elevation of 1,033 meters (3,389 feet) above sea level. The fort’s name, Lohagad,
                                    translates to “Iron Fort,” alluding to its impenetrable and sturdy construction.

                                    History of Lohagad Fort
                                    The initial construction of Lohagad Fort is attributed to the Lohtamia dynasty, who
                                    ruled the region during the 10th century CE. Over the centuries, the fort has
                                    witnessed several battles and changes in ownership, passing through the hands of
                                    various rulers, including the Mughals and the Marathas. In 1648, the legendary
                                    Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured the fort, making it a strategic
                                    stronghold for his kingdom.</p>
