                    <h3>Raigad Fort</h3>
                    <p>Raigad Fort was the capital of the Maratha Empire from 1674 to 1818. It is located on a hilltop
                        in the Sahyadri Mountains and is considered to be one of the most important forts in Indian
                        history. The fort is well-preserved and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside.

                        Raigad Fort*, also known as Rairi or Rairy Fort, is a magnificent hill fort situated in the
                        Sahyadri mountain range, overlooking the town of Mahad in the Raigad district of Maharashtra,
                        India. Standing tall at an elevation of 2,700 feet (820 meters) above its base and 4,449 feet
                        (1,356 meters) above sea level, Raigad Fort offers breathtaking panoramic views of the
                        surrounding landscape. Its strategic location and formidable defenses made it one of the
                        strongest fortresses on the Deccan Plateau.</p>
                    <h4>Historical Significance</h4>
                    <p>Raigad Fort holds immense historical significance as it served as the capital of the Maratha
                        Empire under the legendary Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In 1674, Shivaji was crowned the king of
                        the Maratha kingdom, and Raigad Fort became the center of his administrative and military
                        operations. During his reign, the Maratha Empire flourished and expanded considerably, reaching
                        a significant portion of western and central India.</p>

                    <h3>Shivneri Fort</h3>
                    <p>Shivneri Fort is an ancient military fortification located near Junnar in Pune district in
                        Maharashtra, India. It is the birthplace of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the
                        Maratha Empire. The fort is situated on a hilltop that overlooks the Junnar city. It is a
                        triangular-shaped fort with seven well-defended gates. The fort is surrounded by steep cliffs on
                        all sides, making it difficult to attack. There are many water tanks and wells within the fort
                        complex, which provided a steady supply of water to the fort’s inhabitants.</p>
                    <h4>History of Shivneri Fort</h4>
                    <p>The history of Shivneri Fort dates back to the 6th century. It was initially ruled by the
                        Mauryas, and later by the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas. In the 13th century, the fort
                        came under the control of the Delhi Sultanate. In 1430, the fort was captured by the Adil Shahi
                        dynasty of Bijapur. In 1630, the fort was captured by the Mughal Empire. In 1674, the fort was
                        captured by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.</p>
