                    <h3>Raigad Fort</h3>
                    <p>Raigad Fort was the capital of the Maratha Empire from 1674 to 1818. It is located on a hilltop
                        in the Sahyadri Mountains and is considered to be one of the most important forts in Indian
                        history. The fort is well-preserved and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside.

                        Raigad Fort*, also known as Rairi or Rairy Fort, is a magnificent hill fort situated in the
                        Sahyadri mountain range, overlooking the town of Mahad in the Raigad district of Maharashtra,
                        India. Standing tall at an elevation of 2,700 feet (820 meters) above its base and 4,449 feet
                        (1,356 meters) above sea level, Raigad Fort offers breathtaking panoramic views of the
                        surrounding landscape. Its strategic location and formidable defenses made it one of the
                        strongest fortresses on the Deccan Plateau.</p>
                    <h4>Historical Significance</h4>
                    <p>Raigad Fort holds immense historical significance as it served as the capital of the Maratha
                        Empire under the legendary Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In 1674, Shivaji was crowned the king of
                        the Maratha kingdom, and Raigad Fort became the center of his administrative and military
                        operations. During his reign, the Maratha Empire flourished and expanded considerably, reaching
                        a significant portion of western and central India.</p>

                    <p>Tikona also known as Vitandgad, is the dominant hill fort in Maval in western India. It is
                        located near Kamshet around 60 km from Pune. The village nearest to the fort is called
                        Tikona-Peth. The 3500 foot high hill is pyramidal in shape and the name Tikona means
                        "triangular".

                        Mahadev', seven water tanks (seven water tanks), and some Satvahan caves. Trek organisers also

                    <h4>History of Tikona Fort</h4>
                    <p>Tikona Fort has a vihara from the 7th–8th century A.D. It was conquered in 1585 by Malik Ahmad
                        Nizam Shah I of the Nizam Shahi dynasty. Later, in 1657, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured
                        Tikona along with other forts like Lohagad, Visapur, and Karnala, making it a strategic centre
                        for the Pawana Maval region. In 1660, the Dhamale Deshmukh family was entrusted with the fort’s
                        security. Following the Treaty of Purandar in 1665, Tikona was surrendered to the Mughals but
                        was soon recaptured by the Marathas. In 1682, Sambhaji Maharaj met Aurangzeb’s son, Prince
                        Akbar, at this fort. Finally, in 1818, a small battle with the British led to its capture by
                        them.</p>

                    <p>In 1657, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj added this fort to his kingdom along with Lohagad, Visapur,
                        Tung, and Tikona forts. Later, on 11 March 1818, Colonel Prother of the British tried to capture
                        the fort but failed even after a long siege. Finally, on 14 March 1818, he managed to blow up
                        the stored ammunition with a loose cannonball, which led to the British taking control of the
                        fort.</p>

                    <h3>Suvarnadurg Fort</h3>
                    <p>Suvarnadurg, meaning “Golden Fort,” is a sea fort located near Harnai in Konkan, Maharashtra, on
                        a small island in the Arabian Sea between Mumbai and Goa. It was originally built by the
                        Adilshahi navy for defence and shipbuilding, and later strengthened by Chhatrapati Shivaji
                        Maharaj in 1660. The fort was important for protecting against European colonial powers and
                        local rulers. Earlier, it was connected to the nearby land fort Kanakadurga through a tunnel,
                        but now it can only be reached by boat from Harnai port. Today, Suvarnadurg is a protected
                        monument.</p>
                    <h4>History of Suvarnadurg Fort</h4>
                    <p>After Kanhoji Angre’s death, his sons Sambaji and Tulaji fought for control of Suvarnadurg.
                        Sambaji first held the fort, but Tulaji later became more powerful, leading to conflicts with
                        the Peshwas and the British. In 1755, the Peshwas and the British jointly attacked Suvarnadurg
                        and captured it within days, handing it over to the Peshwas. However, the British gained control
                        of nearby Bankot Fort as a reward. The fort remained with the Peshwas until 1818, when the
                        British finally took it over.
                        The Angres had strengthened Suvarnadurg, built a shipyard, and maintained a large naval fleet to
                        protect the Konkan coast from the British, French, and Dutch. Smaller forts like Kanakadurga,
                        Bankot, and Fattegad were also built to defend Suvarnadurg from land attacks.</p>
