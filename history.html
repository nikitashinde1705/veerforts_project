                      The Rajmudra was the royal seal of the Maratha Empire and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Its inscription in Sanskrit, "प्रतिपच्चंद्रलेखेव वर्धिष्णुर्विश्ववंदिता शाहसुनोः शिवस्यैषा मुद्रा भद्राय राजते" (pratipaccandralekheva vardhiṣṇurviśvavanditā śāhasūnoḥ śivasyaiṣā mudrā bhadrāya rājate), translates to "This Seal of Shivaji, the Son of Shahaji, Increasing in size like the moon of Pratipada (the first day after the moonless night), will be worshiped by the world & will shine only for the well-being of people". It symbolized Shivaji's dream of Swarajya (self-rule) and embodied principles of growth, universal acclaim, and welfare for his people."Rajmudra" means the "Royal Seal" or "Great Seal" of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. It is a symbol of his dream for Swarajya (self-rule) and carries a prophetic message: "The glory of this Mudra [Seal] of Shahaji's son Shivaji will grow like the first-day moon; it will be worshipped by the world and will shine only for the well-being of people".
                      The owner and founder of the Rajmudra Group is Dnyaneshwar Pachundkar Patil. He established the group, beginning with Rajmudra Tours & Travels and expanding it into a diverse portfolio of companies in sectors such as transportation, green energy, and eco-friendly products.
                        Key aspects of the Rajmudra:
                      <h2>Royal Seal:</h2>
                     It was the official royal seal used on letters and ordinances by Shivaji Maharaj. 
                      <h2>Symbolism of Growth:</h2>
                      The analogy of the crescent moon signifies continuous growth and expansion in glory and influence.
